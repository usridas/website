                      Objective: Creating a video game that highlights the
                      importance of mental health, how it affects you, and how
                      to make decisions based on your own desires, rather than
                      based on the influence of others.

                    <div>
                      Here is my brainstorm session within my design sketchbook.
                      I had some ideas of what I wanted the video game to entail
                      and how I wanted to express it via design. Since I am a
                      mental health advocate, I thought a game would be an
                      interesting and immersive way to open up conversation.
                    </div>
                  </br>
                    <div>
                      These are some designs and mockups I made via Pixilart, a
                      free online tool to create pixelated artwork and Adobe
                      Illustrator. I really enjoyed experimenting with pixel art
                      which was eye-catching and intricate. I wanted the game to
                      capture the emotions and hardships of growing up and
                      finding your own path, so I emphasized it with a
                      nostalgic, retro style.

                    <div>Objective: Designing a multi-sensory artistic experience for an audience to enjoy. These are some different ways people can interact with the art and listen to music simultaneously.  By combining art and music elements, the audience can fully immerse themselves in an audiovisual experience.</div>

                    <div>For the two images above, you can use Spotify to scan the codes and listen to songs I enjoy.  These are meant to be printed onto a square sheet of paper to act as sort of a "paper disk", each with a different song or playlist.</div>

                    <div>For the two images below, you can use your phone camera to scan the QR codes and listen to songs I associate with the photos I have taken.  These are double-sided cards (approximately the size of a playing card) that include the photo in the front and the QR code in the back.  Each card is made for a different song.</div>

This basic Android app allows users to quickly record symptoms and contact emergency if necessary. This is an easy way to stay cognizant of your own health during the COVID-19 pandemic and promotes CDC social distancing guidelines.  Within my group, I was responsible for project ideation, diagram creation, and software development and also assisted with general research.</div>

                    <div>These are the pages of my Android application. I wanted to include pastel colors, so as to not induce panic. The blues are associated with the medical field/medical terms, while the yellow serves as a caution, and red shows an alert.  I made these with Android Studio.</div>
